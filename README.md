# Neo Lensa - YOLOv7 + PyQt5

**Neo Lensa** is a desktop application that integrates **YOLOv7** with **PyQt5** for object detection in real-time and offline modes. It allows users to process live camera feeds (webcams or RTSP streams) or analyze pre-recorded video files. Designed for ease of use, Neo Lensa provides a smooth UI for AI-powered object detection.

## Features
- **Real-time Detection** – Supports webcam and RTSP streams for live object detection.
- **Offline Mode** – Process pre-recorded videos for analysis.
- **User-Friendly UI** – Built with PyQt5 for an intuitive experience.
- **Custom Model Support** – Load and run custom YOLOv7 models.
- **Efficient Processing** – Optimized for speed and accuracy.
